# reliability-theory
Compute the probabiity of a compound system to fail.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_theory

## Goal
Given a system composed of several parallel or series subsystems, each of which succeeds which a given or unknown probability, compute the succeed rate of the full system.

It contains a **literal expression simplificator**. So you can enter a system with both hard-coded and literal reliability values, the result will always be printed nicely.

## How to use
Launch the program. Enter a system in the following syntax
